# Resistance Training Optimization: A Study of Strength Gains
This study analyzes resistance training data. A recommender systems approach based on
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used to generate target weight advice for athletes and
coaches accurately. This model is used to track athlete’s strength over time. Subsequently,
XGBoost has been employed to predict the strength gain or loss. From XGBoost’s feature
importances new training successful behaviours could be discovered. Because the XGBoost
regressor has not been able to successfully predict the strength change, nothing could be learned
from the feature importances. Although unsuccessful, this model has the potential to be useful
for athletes.
